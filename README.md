# Pelco D Telemetry Decoder (node-pelcod-decoder)

This module reads Pelco D CCTV Camera Pan/Tilt/Zoom data, validates each command and decode its meaning.
The descripion of each command is written to the console. The Pelco D commands decoded include
  Camera Number
  Pan  (direction and speed)
  Tilt (direction and speed)
  Zoom
  Manual Focus
  Manual Iris
  Store Preset
  Goto Preset
  Clear Preset
  Auxiliary On
  Auxiliary Off

# Baud Rates
Pelco D often runs at 2400 baud 8-N-1 or at 9600 baud 8-N-1
Pelco D telemery is always 7 bytes long and always starts with 0xFF

# Stream Sources
The module will read from a NodeJS stream and currently reads from a Serial Port (using node-serial). It can also run with a Memory Stream

# Future Enhancements
A future enhancement would be to drive an I/O module or send USB commands to drive motors or relays.
Another enhancement would be to output a new Pan/Tilt/Zoom telemetry command in a different format to drive other makes of camera (ie a protocol converter)

# Pelco D Testing
The code has been tested with Pelco D telemetry generated by https://github.com/Scoup/node-pelcod and by some CCTV Engineer test tools (Bosch Camset)
