# Pelco D Telemetry Decoder (node-pelcod-decoder)

This module reads Pelco D CCTV Camera Pan/Tilt/Zoom data, validates each command and decodes its meaning.
The descripion of each command is written to the console. The Pelco D commands decoded include  
  * Camera Number
  * Pan  (direction and speed)
  * Tilt (direction and speed)
  * Zoom
  * Manual Focus
  * Manual Iris
  * Store Preset / Goto Preset / Clear Preset
  * Set Auxiliary (Turn On) / Clear Auxiliary (Turn Off)
  * Start Learning Pattern (Tour) / Stop Learning Pattern (Tour) / Run Pattern (Tour)

# Baud Rates
Pelco D telemery is always 7 bytes long and always starts with 0xFF. Pelco D often runs at 2400 baud 8-N-1 with 4800 and 9600 also common.

# Stream Sources
The module processes data from a NodeJS Buffer object. A small example program, read_from_serial.js, will read from a Serial Port / COM Port (using node-serial) and pass data into the Pelco D Decoder.

# Future Enhancements
A future enhancement would be to use an I/O module to drive motors or relays.
Another enhancement would be to output a new Pan/Tilt/Zoom telemetry command in a different protocol format to drive other makes of camera (ie a protocol converter)

# Pelco D Testing
The code has been tested with Pelco D telemetry generated by
 * Pelco KBD300A Keyboard in Direct D mode (Rev A0, Ver 5.7)
 * NodeJS Pelco D Generator https://github.com/Scoup/node-pelcod
 * Bosch Universal Camset CCTV Engineer Tool
 * ISpyConnect http://www.ispyconnect.com/
